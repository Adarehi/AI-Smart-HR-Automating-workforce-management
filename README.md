These tools are all interconnected via Staff Name and Staff ID as a Primary Key:
1.	Employee Attendance Tracker
2.	Salary Schedule Table
3.	PaySlip Generator
4.	HR Dashboard
Together, these tools turn raw HR data into actionable insights.

A. Employee Attendance Tracker 
•	Tracks daily presence, lateness, absence
•	Auto-penalty for absence or lateness
•	Monthly summary of staff performance
•	Integrated with a calendar logic
•	Tools used:
o	Excel formulas (IF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP)
o	VBA (automated date handling)
o	Conditional formatting for visualization

B. Salary Schedule Table (2 mins)
•	Monthly salary sheet with staff details
•	Auto-populates from attendance & position
•	Calculates deductions and net pay
•	Includes status column (Salary Approved / On Hold)
•	Tools used:
o	Excel tables
o	Dynamic formulas
o	Data validation

C. PaySlip Generator (2 mins)
•	Auto-generated per staff using Staff ID
•	Pulls details from salary schedule and attendance
•	Printable and email-compatible
•	Tools used:
o	Excel + VBA
o	Lookup functions
o	Print settings for formatting

D. HR Dashboard (3 mins)
•	Key metrics:
o	Staff attendance rate
o	Monthly payroll totals
o	Latecomer ranking
o	Staff status summary
•	Real-time filtering by department/month
•	Visuals include charts, slicers, sparklines
•	Tools used:
o	Pivot Tables
o	Excel Charts
o	Slicers & Dashboards


•	Show live metrics (e.g., attendance heatmap, salary trends)
•	Highlight a specific case: e.g., "How we discovered top 5 consistent latecomers"
•	Discuss time saved (manual effort reduced by 60%)

Impact:
•	Centralized HR data
•	Faster decision-making
•	Real-time staff performance monitoring
•	Scalable to 300+ staff
Lessons Learned:
•	Power of data cleaning and structured data
•	VBA enhances Excel automation significantly
•	Visualization communicates more than raw tables

This project shows how we can turn everyday HR work into data-powered intelligence, making HR not just about records—but about results.
